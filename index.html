    <h1>Hey, there.</h1>
    <p>I’m a product designer and full-stack developer based out of Denver, Colorado. I focus on building interfaces that are beautiful, simple, and intuitive. I enjoy bringing ideas to life and have had the pleasure working with various startups across from small side projects to larger, multi-million dollar companies.
      <br><br>
      I’m currently working with <a href="http://myipsat.com" target="_blank">nexleader IPSAT</a> to create a platform for helping people recognize their own leadership potential. I previously had the opportunity to work with <a href="http://blinklending.ca" target="_blank">Blink Lending</a>, where I worked on designing and developing an online mortgage experience for both brokers and home buyers.
      <br><br>
      In addition to freelance design and development, I am currently working on a side project—Stand Up—a small tool to help keep teams connected.
      <br><br>
      I’m scoping out new projects to work on, so email <a href="mailto:henry@kaufman.io">henry@kaufman.io</a> if you need a hand!
